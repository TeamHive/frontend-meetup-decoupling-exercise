# Frontend Meetup Decoupling Exercise

## Your exercise

This is a sample application that has 3 pages (home, content, and profile) and a component (content-item).

Decouple these pages into separate feature libs.


## Generate an application

Run `ng g @nrwl/angular:app my-app` to generate an application.

> You can use any of the plugins above to generate applications as well.

When using Nx, you can create multiple applications and libraries in the same workspace.

## Generate a library

Run `ng g @nrwl/angular:lib my-lib` to generate a library.

> You can also use any of the plugins above to generate libraries as well.

Libraries are shareable across libraries and applications. They can be imported from `@frontend-meetup-decoupling-exercise/mylib`.

## Development server

Run `ng serve my-app` for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng g component my-component --project=my-app` to generate a new component.

## Understand your workspace

Run `nx dep-graph` to see a diagram of the dependencies of your projects.
